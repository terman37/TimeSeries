Non Seasonal ARIMA model
ARIMA means Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average

xt is an ARIMAp,d,q model if âˆ†dxt is an ARMAp,q model

ARIMA(0,1,0) = random walk
ARIMA(0,1,1) without constant = simple exponential smoothing
ARIMA(0,2,1) without constant = linear exponential smoothing
ARIMA(1,1,2) with constant = damped-trend linear exponential smoothing
