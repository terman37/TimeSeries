Libraries
```{r}
library(forecast)
library(ggplot2)
```

Loading dataset
```{r}
data(AirPassengers)
autoplot(AirPassengers)
```


```{r}
autoplot(decompose(AirPassengers,type="multiplicative"))+xlab('Year')
```

```{r}
autoplot(AirPassengers)
length(AirPassengers)
```

remove seasonal pattern
```{r}
res1 = diff(AirPassengers,lag=12,differences=1)
autoplot(res1)
length(res1)
```

still a slight trend, apply diff again 
Rem: no need for lag=12, no seasonal pattern, allow to keep more points
```{r}
res2 = diff(res1,lag=1)
autoplot(res2)
length(res2)
```

check autocorrelation
acf of order 1 ~ -0.3 --> still correlation between xt and xt-1
```{r}
acf(res2)
```

Confirm with box test:
Check if white noise
p-value small (<0.05) --> HO rejected --> not white noise
```{r}
Box.test(res2,lag=10,type="Ljung-Box")$p.value
```

--> some autocorrelation to modelize.
